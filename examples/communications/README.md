Example of communication between three hepia light carts

## Physical connections

Connect three hepia light cards vertically creating a stack of three cards high.
All cards should have their arrows pointing up, and be connected with 10 pin connector.

The card at the bottom is the _South_ card, the one in the center is the _Centre_ card,
and the third one is the _North_ card.

Flash each card with the appropriate _MAIN.PY_ files that are available in this readme folder.

**Make sure to rename each Main\_###.PY to MAIN.py before compying it to the card.**
